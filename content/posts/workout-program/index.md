### Aquatic's 5 Day Workout Split - Modified Push Pull Leg
---

#### Focus Bodypart : **Shoulder, Back**

**Monday** - Chest + Triceps + Side Delt\
**Tuesday** - Back + Bicep\
**Wednesday** - Legs\
**Thursday** - Shoulders\
**Friday** - Back + Bicep\
**Weekend** - Rest \* 2

> I only train legs once a week, because I need more recover time for my lower body.

> I don't train chest on second push day, because I want to focus on my Delt.

#### Every exercise is performed to 3 sets (not counting warmups), with 6-12 RM weight to 0-1 RIR

Sometimes a 4th set dropset immediately after the 3rd set to incur more metabolic stress.
